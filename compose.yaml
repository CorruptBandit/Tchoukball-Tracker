    # bind-mounting these two files in will let you add packages during development without rebuilding
    # for example, to add bower to your app while developing, just install it inside the container
    # and then nodemon will restart. Your changes will last until you "docker compose down" and will
    # be saved on host for next build.
    # remember to isntall from the parent directory to the code bind-mount:
    # docker compose exec -w /opt/node_app node npm install --save bower

    # this is a workaround to prevent host node_modules from accidently getting mounted in container
    # in case you want to use node/npm both outside container for test/lint etc. and also inside container
    # this will overwrite the default node_modules dir in container so it won't conflict with our
    # /opt/node_app/node_modules location.
